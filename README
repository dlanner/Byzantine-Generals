Some thoughts:

what do we want to test?
the lieutenants should be able to agree upon a consensus

unit tests for algms

use OptionParser for CLI (e.g. --nodes / -n number of nodes, -m number-of-traitors, --output / -o for formatting as graph)
TODO: visualize / graph: https://github.com/glejeune/Ruby-Graphviz

OM(m) - Oral Message algorithm / method
SM(m) - Signed Message algorithm / method

advanced: OM(m,p) (not fully connected graph)


OM(m)
Setup:
n nodes, 1 of which is the general, and the rest (n-1) of which are lieutenants

Input:
m faulty nodes

Output: 
Value v agreed upon by the n-1 lieutenants
